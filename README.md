# TRIP
***TRIP*** is a pipeline for identifying the TRM in NGS short reads (DNA). TRIP is ultra-fast, easy-to-use, and accurate. During our test in more than 100 species, ***TRIP*** successfully identified several unexpected novel TRM, all known TRM, with no false-positive case. For species which has no TRM (Dipteran, etc), ***TRIP*** smartly will identify 0 TRM candidates.

***TRIP*** is designed to be able to take advantage of all public data. Therefore, the basic usage of ***TRIP*** is just to provide a table, using default parameters, set a ***LARGE*** `--process_num` (the calculation of ***TRIP*** is very small, the bottleneck is actually the downloading speed from NCBI/ENA database), run it in background, and enjoy the rest of your life. To make life easier, ***TRIP*** also set `--continue True` as default, so you don't have to worry about any failure, just re-run it if needed. Since most public data is huge, you can use `--downsample` to limit download size.

# Installation
0. **Pre-needed** 
- Linux system (not supporting Windows.)
- **weget, python3, bash, tail, cat, rm** commands should be able to be called.
- **matplotlib
    multiprocessing
    os
    sys
    pandas
    inspect
    numpy
    requests
    random
    bs4
    time
    traceback
    multiprocessing
    hashlib** package should be installed in python3.

1. Download the code and store the code folder in someplace. ***Do not change the content in the folder***.

2. `chmod -R 777 /path/to/TRIP` Try to run `RepeatDetector_v2` in ***TRIP***, if you see

rather than `pemission denied`, then you should be cool.

# Basic usage (pipeline of auto: web-crawl > download reads > analyze > filter results > output plots and tables)

## command line
> python3 path/to/TRIP/TRIP.py --input path/to/TRIP/example_input.tsv --output ./ --process_num 100

## input file
***TRIP*** will parse the input file (make sure your input file is the same format as example_input.tsv). Each row in input file is a sample. 

The **NAME** column should be unique.

The **BIOPROJECT** column should be correctï¼Œ otherwise ***TRIP*** cannot process corresponding sample. The definition of **BIOPROJECT** can be found in [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/). ***TRIP*** need this to download reads.

The **ASSEMBLY** column should be correct, otherwise ***TRIP*** cannot process corresponding sample. The definition of **ASSEMBLY** can be found in [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly). ***TRIP*** need this to get genome size for further computation.

In **example_input.tsv**, we have 2 samples to check. One is CARCR (Cariama cristata), another is HARAX (Harmonia axyridis). For CARCR, the BIOPROJECT  is [PRJNA212889](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA212889?show=reads), the ASSEMBLY is [GCA_000690535.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000690535.1) (GCF_000690535.1 also works). 

## output files

- `TRIP_results/CARCR` : 
- CARCR_PRJNA212889_tsv.txt is the downloaded reads records file
- CARCR.repeat CARCR.repeatsummary.tsv and CARCR.stat are the ***RepeatMaster*** processed results 
- ENA2URL.sh  genome_size  md5_log  url  url_filtered  wget.sh are intermediate files
- SRR9946514_2.fastq.gz SRR9946514_1.fastq.gz are downloaded reads
- CRPG_input.tsv is file that will pass to `cal_repeats_per_genome_and_percent_of_len_linux.py` in ***TRIP***


- `TRIP_results/TR_candidates` 

# Q&A
***Why my TRIP seems not to be running?***

At beginning, you may observe no running via `htop` or other background-check command, which is because TRIP is downloading files `tree path/to/TRIP_results to check`, the `wget` method built-in TRIP consumes neglectable computing resources.

***Can TRIP handle long sequencing reads?***

We haven't tested it. But we offer `--skip_subreads`, which will let ***TRIP*** skip reads names containing "subreads".
